It keeps track of one current state and on each iteration moves to the neighboring state with highest value—that is, it heads in the direction that provides the steepest ascent. It terminates when it reaches a “peak” where no neighbor has a higher value. Hill climbing does not look ahead beyond the immediate neighbors of the current state. This resembles trying to find the top of Mount Everest in a thick fog while suffering from amnesia. \n",
